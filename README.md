# Emitrr_project
ü©∫ Physician Notetaker
This project is a comprehensive tool designed to process unstructured clinical transcripts and convert them into valuable, structured data. By leveraging a suite of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, this application automates the tedious process of manual data extraction, saving time for healthcare professionals and reducing the risk of error.

The application, built with Streamlit, provides three core functionalities:

Structured Clinical Summary: Extracts key medical information (symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, etc.) into a clean JSON format.

Patient Sentiment Analysis: Performs a line-by-line analysis of the patient's dialogue to identify sentiment (Anxious, Neutral, Reassured) and intent.

Generative SOAP Note: Utilizes a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a complete, well-structured SOAP note from the transcript.
(I ran out of time to generate a dataset for this task and train the NLP model as there is no solid data set available.)

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Application Framework:** Streamlit  

- **NLP & AI:**  
  - Hugging Face `transformers` for local NLP models  
  - `PyTorch` as the backend for transformer models  
  - Google `generativeai` for the generative SOAP note feature  

- **Core Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn (for model metrics)  

- **Models Used:**  
  - **Medical NER:** `d4data/biomedical-ner-all`  
  - **General NER (Names):** `dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english`  
  - **Question Answering:** `deepset/roberta-large-squad2`  
  - **Custom Sentiment:** Fine-tuned `distilbert-base-uncased`  
  - **Intent Detection:** `facebook/bart-large-mnli` (Zero-Shot)  
  - **SOAP Generation:** Google `Gemini-2.5-PRO`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

---

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python **3.11** (recommended to avoid dependency issues).  
- A **Google AI Studio API Key** for the SOAP Note generation feature.  

---

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ypranav17/Emitrr_project.git
cd Emitrr_project

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

For Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

For macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required libraries from requirements.txt.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Additionally, install PyTorch (CPU version), TorchVision, and Google Generative AI:

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install google-generativeai

4. Train the Custom Sentiment Model

The sentiment analysis feature relies on a custom-trained model.

Navigate to the utils directory and run the training script:

cd utils
python train_sentiment_model.py

This will create a final_sentiment_model folder inside /utils, which the main application will use.

5. Run the Streamlit Application

After training the model, run the Streamlit app from the /UI directory.

cd ../UI
streamlit run main_app.py
