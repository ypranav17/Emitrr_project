# Emitrr_project
ðŸ©º Physician Notetaker
This project is a comprehensive tool designed to process unstructured clinical transcripts and convert them into valuable, structured data. By leveraging a suite of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, this application automates the tedious process of manual data extraction, saving time for healthcare professionals and reducing the risk of error.

The application, built with Streamlit, provides three core functionalities:

Structured Clinical Summary: Extracts key medical information (symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, etc.) into a clean JSON format.

Patient Sentiment Analysis: Performs a line-by-line analysis of the patient's dialogue to identify sentiment (Anxious, Neutral, Reassured) and intent.

Generative SOAP Note: Utilizes a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a complete, well-structured SOAP note from the transcript.
(I ran out of time to generate a dataset for this task and train the NLP model as there is no solid data set available.)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

  - **SOAP Generation:** Google `Gemini-2.5-PRO`

Setup and Installation
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.11. It is highly recommended to use this specific version to avoid potential compilation issues with dependencies.

A Google AI Studio API Key for the SOAP Note generation feature.

2. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/medical-ai-insights.git](https://github.com/your-username/medical-ai-insights.git)
cd medical-ai-insights

3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required libraries from the requirements.txt file. The project is structured with the main app in the /UI directory and training scripts in /utils.

# Navigate to the root of the project where requirements.txt is located
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu)
pip install google-generativeai

5. Train the Custom Sentiment Model
The sentiment analysis feature relies on a custom-trained model. Run the training script located in the /utils directory.

# Navigate to the utils directory
cd utils

# Run the training script
python train_sentiment_model.py

This will create a final_sentiment_model folder inside /utils, which the main application will load.

6. Run the Streamlit Application
Navigate to the /UI directory and run the main application script.

# Navigate to the UI directory from the root
cd ../UI

# Run the app
streamlit run main_app.py
